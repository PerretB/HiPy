"""
The "Structure" module contains the definitions of the fundamental data structures
used in the HiPy library.

Image is the base class to store data.
An Image is basically an integer indexed list with utility functions.

An image may be associated with an Adjacency that describes the neighbouring relations among its
pixels.
The classes of the Adjacency hierarchy are:
    * AbstractAdjacency: the base class of all adjacencies.
    * AbstractWeightedAdjacency: mixin between AbstactAdjacency and Image, as a valued object it \
    can be processed as an image!
    * WeightedAdjacency: extends AbstractWeightedAdjacency, describes a non-directed weighted \
    adjacency (list based representation, suitable only for sparse graphs).
    * DirectedWeightedAdjacency: extends AbstractWeightedAdjacency, describes a directed weighted \
    adjacency (list based representation, suitable only for sparse graphs).
    * AdjacencyNdRegular: extends AbstractAdjacency, implicit representation of a translation \
    invariant adjacency
    * AdjacencyTree: extends AbstractAdjacency, wraps a tree into an Adjacency

An image may be associated with an Embedding that maps its linear integer coordinate
to another space.
The classes of the Embedding hierarchy are:
    * AbstractEmbedding: the base class of all Embeddings.
    * Embedding2dGrid: maps the integers to 2d pixel coordinates.
